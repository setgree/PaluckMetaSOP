  This paper describes the motivations and procedures for meta-analyses by Betsy Levy Paluck and co-authors, with reference to and examples drawn from three such papers (Paluck, Green, and Green 2019, Paluck et al. 2020, and Porat et al. 2024). We first describe our conceptual aims when writing meta-analytic papers, which are to provide an 'on-ramp' to interested readers, to evaluate a literature's strengths and weaknesses, and to illuminate empirical gaps, which we intend as signposts for future researchers. Second, we describe the typical 'flow' of the papers as a whole. Third, we describe our meta-analytic procedures, detailing our default reporting structure and analytic choices and engaging with recent critiques from Slough and Tyson (2022) and Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson (2022). Fourth, we introduce a collection of functions we use to implement our meta-analytic choices, available as an R package. Fifth, we conclude with some open questions for meta-analysts.

## Introduction: the divergent approaches of meta-analysis and meta-science

What purposes do meta-analyses serve above and beyond those accomplished by systematic reviews? Judging by recent papers in social psychology [@pettigrew2006; @bem2015; @cuddy2018; @bezrukova2016], the answer is to bolster and validate existing findings through aggregation. By pooling findings from many studies, researchers furnish meta-analytic estimates that are typically heartening to a literature's boosters because they are statistically precise and drawn from diverse settings, which gives readers the impression of durable, widely applicable findings. Such papers often have a valedictory quality to them: they provide leading practitioners a chance to survey the body of work they've helped inspire, highlight the strength of the evidence for their subfield's central tenets, and suggest future research directions that assume those tenets are no longer in need of testing.

Meanwhile, a parallel movement in psychology has begun to implement the recommendations of the open science [@nosek2015] and meta-science [@schooler2014] movements into study designs [@ferguson2023], journal policies [@hardwicke2023transparency], and literature reviews [@hardwicke2018]. Broadly speaking, meta-scientific papers aim to assess whether a literature's findings are *credible* rather than to confirm them. While meta-analyses seek to integrate a set of results (taken more or less at face value), meta-science papers ask instead whether a literature's designs, analyses, and implementations license the inferences their authors draw.

Some meta-scientific reviews quantitatively assess collective outcomes, for instance, what percentage of a subset of papers are computationally reproducible [@obels2020] or consistent with open data standards [@hardwicke2021]. In one sense, these estimates are 'meta-analytic,' but they aren't meta-analyses in the conventional sense of pooling existing findings into weighted average effects [@glass1977; @kleinstauber1996; @cooper2019]. In tone, meta-science papers are often much more critical than meta-analyses are, and they are often written by outsiders or newcomers to an academic field who appear more motivated to interrogate than to validate. Thus, their similar names notwithstanding, meta-analytic and meta-scientific papers in social psychology typically have radically different perspectives, assumptions, and goals.

At the Paluck lab, we seek to synthesize these two approaches by writing meta-analyses that are fundamentally meta-scientific. Over the course of four systematic reviews, three with meta-analytic components [@paluck2009; @paluck2019; @paluck2021; @porat2024], we've developed distinct beliefs about where and when a meta-analysis is useful, how to structure the meta-analytic sections of our systematic reviews, and which specifications are sensible defaults. This paper articulates those beliefs, and aims to illuminate how meta-analysis might become a standard component of the meta-scientific toolkit.

### Bridging the gap between meta-analytic theory and Standard Operating Procedures 

Previous papers have noted potential pitfalls for meta-analysts (e.g. @greco2013), detailed common statistical errors in their application [@kadlec2023], or noted that they are often not computationally reproducible [@lakens2017]. This paper sits in that tradition, but is a bit of an offshoot in that we are not attempting to correct statistical or practical mistakes in meta-analyses, but rather articulate what it is that we are trying to do when we write them. In this regard, this paper is closely in dialogue with two recent papers that attempt to put meta-analysis on firmer theoretical footing. @slough2023 "highlight the dangers of conflating conceptual differences across studies with statistical sources of variation" (p. 29). They argue that for studies to "identify the same empirical target" (p. 1), they must have fundamentally *harmonized* contrasts and measurement strategies, i.e. the "substantive comparison across studies is the same" and "the outcome of interest is the same and it is measured in the same way" (p. 2). Absent these conditions, meta-analytic results might not be "meaningful and interpretable" (p. 2). Contrary to conventional approaches to improving the accuracy of meta-analyses, a lack of target equivalence cannot be "solved solely with statistical techniques" (p. 23). Rather, it is more likely to be achieved through "design or inclusion criteria" (p. 2).

We agree that an internally and externally valid causal meta-analytic estimate requires harmonization of contrasts and outcomes (as well as a high degree of internal validity within constituent studies). However, we also think that meta-analytic estimates which do *not* meet these conditions \textemdash e.g. those that combine results from many different designs, or whose diverse outcomes bear an unknown relationship to the true outcome of interest \textemdash can still be useful and informative if interpreted and framed correctly. We think that when a literature without clear harmony of the independent and dependent variables is a case where the underlying model might be "wrong" but still useful.

The other paper in this vein we look to is @simonsohn2022, who argue that while the typical meta-analysis in social psychology aims "to be comprehensive, results-focused and transcriptive," this is "misguided, leading to uninterpretable results that misrepresent research literatures." First, they argue that a desire for comprehensiveness typically leads the meta- analyst to average "studies of the highest quality" with "studies that lack internal validity or external validity, which are obtained using incorrect statistical techniques, or studies where results seem to arise from methodological artefacts." This throw-it-all-in-the-blender approach produces results that are "virtually guaranteed to lack a meaningful interpretation," despite their putative statistical precision. Second, the authors encourage meta-analysts to focus on studies' designs, rather than just their results, to provide "readers with information that they can use to evaluate" the quality of a research literature for themselves. Rather than describing every study, meta-analysts "can succinctly describe and summarize common design failures...and provide detailed descriptions only of the studies they deem most important or compelling." This advice ties closely to their last dictum to meta-analysts: to evaluate rather than to transcribe, i.e., detail the evidence from the very best studies, identify common methodological shortcomings of the literature as a whole, and, finally, "discuss what open questions remain and what kinds of evidence would help answer those questions."

Our meta-analyses share these goals (and @paluck2021 is cited therein for being "selective, design-focused, and evaluative"). Moreover, the authors note that typical guides to meta-analysis "briefly mention validity concerns but provide little guidance as to how to carry out quality control;" one of the aims of this paper is to provide such guidance. However, as mentioned above, we part ways from this paper in that we believe comprehensive meta-analytic estimates still have a place in the meta-scientist's toolkit, so long as those estimates are ascribed descriptive rather than causal meaning and are used to contextualize further, more selective analyses.

This paper also builds on a tradition of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in the behavioral and medical sciences [@rapport2013; @wallace2015; @lakens2023]. In particular, we look to @lin2016, which details how the Green lab at Columbia sets "default practices to guide decisions when issues arise that were not anticipated in" pre-analysis plans. Like that paper, this article is not intended as a comprehensive guide to the task in question \textemdash see @cumpston2019 and @cooper2019 for textbook-length treatments of meta-analysis, and @frank2024, chapter 16, @lakens2022, chapter 11 and Slough and Tyson (forthcoming), chapter 5 for modern treatments of the subject aimed at social scientists. Rather, we articulate our lab's admittedly idiosyncratic approach to a task that many research groups embark on. We hope this will prove interesting and informative, but not definitive: we expect readers to adapt and expand our guidelines to meet their own needs. In general, we hope to see more labs publish papers about how they produce knowledge.

### The remainder of this paper

This paper is a hybrid of a conceptual analysis of meta-analyses in general and a report on how we in particular write them. The first two sections articulate our general approach to meta-analysis. The next three detail our standard practices. Our conclusion recaps and notes some open questions for our lab.

First, we describe our conceptual aims with meta-analysis, and where ameta-analysis adds something above and beyond a systematic review. We believe that meta-analyses are useful for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of large, heterogeneous literatures, especially those that bring multiple theoretical perspectives to bear. We further believe that condensing each study down to a point estimate (or cluster of estimates) and associated variance(s) can furnish

Second, we detail our thinking about the tradeoff between comprehensive, potentially biased meta-analytic estimates and focused but also narrower quantitative reviews that set strict inclusion criteria around study design, interventions, and/or dependent variables. Contrary to critics who argue that core assumptions about homogeneity across experimental contrasts and outcomes are necessary for the standard meta-analytic model to hold [@slough2023], we think that comprehensive, heterogeneous meta-analyses can still be useful when these conditions aren't met; in such cases, meta-analytic estimates should be treated as *descriptive* rather than *causal* inferences. Moreover, we see value in contrasting all-inclusive estimates, which are fundamentally descriptive, to more rigorous, focused estimates, which, because they reflect strict selection criteria related to study design and outcome measurement, are more plausibly causal. The within-paper contrast in magnitude and precision between these two approaches is often startling and illuminating.

Third, we describe the typical structure of our meta-analytic papers. In general, we start by describing the main ideas and trends in a literature, which provides readers an 'onramp' into the field's major findings and concerns. Our papers then describe our search processes and meta-analytic methods, followed by our meta-analytic findings. These analyses are structured to start big and go small, meaning that we first present meta-analytic estimates and tests for publication bias for the entire literature and then hone in on key quantities of interest from smaller subsets of the data. For instance, in a literature with randomized controlled trials, quasi-experiments, and observational designs, as well as a mix of attitudinal and behavioral outcomes, we might first present an overall meta-analytic effect, and then present a 3 by 2 table where each subset of study design + outcome strategy gets its own meta-analytic estimate. Alternatively, in a literature with many similar but distinct quantities of interest, e.g. racial/ethnic prejudice vs. prejudice against LGBTQ+ people vs. prejudice against people with physical and mental disabilities, we would present the meta-analytic effects within each subset of data. Our concluding investigations tend to probe differences in effect size by some marker of study quality, e.g. the presence of a pre-analysis plan, or the relationship between effect sizes within studies, e.g. if changes to ideas tend to predict changes in behaviors.

Fourth, we detail our meta-analytic defaults. For instance, we use a random effects model, as implemented by the `metafor` package in R [@viechtbauer2010], rather than a fixed effects (sometimes called an equal effects) model, and we cluster our analyses at the level of an individual study. Further, we prefer Glass's $\Delta$ to Cohen's *d* so as to avoid an additional assumption about the effects of treatment on the underlying distribution of outcomes. Here, we also detail a novel estimator for converting difference in proportion to an effect size that has some desirable properties relative to the conventional conversion from an odds ratio [@gomila2021].

Fifth, we introduce an R package, `PaluckMetaSOP`, that contains functions to help us quickly and efficiently perform meta-analyses. We describe the main categories of function and provide brief usage examples.

Finally, we conclude by noting some open questions for meta-scientific meta-analyses. While we tend to begin meta-analytic projects with a sense of what's true and what's interesting, in practice, the most incisive questions often emerge after reading and coding studies, i.e. after data collection has begun. In other words, meta-analyses are both *hypothesis_driven* (re: deductive) and *data-driven* (re: inductive); However, typical checks on researcher degrees of freedom assume a hypothesis-driven framework. This makes it tricky to "tie one's hands to the mast" [@elster1977], e.g., by writing a detailed pre-analysis plan and pre-specifying which outcomes to focus on. We describe how we've dealt with such issues so far and how we think to improve going forward. Last, we discuss the difficulty of integrating indirect cues of study quality, e.g. obviously mistaken statistical results or special attention devoted to reproducibility, into our analyses in a principled way.

We now detail our conceptual aims when we write meta-analyses.

## The purposes and contributions of meta-analysis

The main goals of our meta-analysis are the goals of any systematic review: to evaluate a body of knowledge for its strengths, weaknesses, central findings, open questions and empirical limitations. We write broadly for any reader who is interested in the underlying question, but generally aim for a non-specialist audience. In our experience, a literature's most noteworthy contributions often come from researchers outside the core field (e.g. @mousa2020, @boisjoly2006, or @scacco2018 for the contact hypothesis, @munger2017 for anti-prejudice work, or @haushofer2019 for violence against women); to such researchers, we aim to provide signposts, in the form of unearthed, widespread empirical gaps and theoretical limitations, about where future empirical work will be most valuable. We also believe that grant-making institutuions and policymakers will generally benefit from systematic, critical reviews that do not take subject matter expertise for granted.

In general, large, heterogeneous literatures, especially those with multiple theoretical perspectives, are good candidates for meta-analysis. In such cases, a meta-analysis might provide a useful contribution simply by dividing a literature into its constituent parts. For example, @paluck2021 categorizes 418 experiments published between 2007 and 2019 and organizes them into thirteen theoretical approaches and twelve categories of prejudice targeted. Simply identifying this heterogeneity of approaches and outcomes, along with describing a few constituent studies from the major theoretical strands in detail, helps the reader evaluate a literature's major findings for herself. In this particular case, a reader might reasonably wonder: does an intervention that aims to change political attitudes towards the rights of trans persons [@broockman2016] shed light on what might reduce tensions between castes in India [@lowe2021]? Is an extended contact intervention [@shamoa2023] similar enough to a diversity training [@chang2019] that you can pool the effects together into something that coherently reflects the effects of a class of intervention? These questions come down to beliefs, and, as @slough2023 argue, cannot be resolved with statistics. A comprehensive and well-organized review is an indispensable tool for clarifying which questions to ask in the first place.

We also encourage authors not to be discouraged from writing meta-analyses of subjects that have been previously reviewed and analyzed, even many times. First, in our experience, simply reproducing the work of previous meta-analyses verbatim might generate surprises. For example, Pettigrew & Troop's landmark meta-analysis -@pettigrew2006 identified 515 studies and 36 "true experiments" (p. 759) on intergroup contact; however, when we took a look at these papers for ourselves, we found that many "were mislabeled as randomly assigned, did not feature 'actual face-to-face interaction' or did not have a non-contact control group;" between these issues and papers that lacked long-term outcome measurement, we ended up with nine experiments that met our inclusion criteria. Second, we share Munger's -@munger2023 cocnern for "temporal validity," the idea that because the conditions under which findings hold might change dramatically going forward, "no research design, no empirical knowledge, is perfectible" (p. 1). For instance, the implicit bias [@gawronski2019] and symbolic racism [@mcconahay1976; @sears2003] research agendas emerged because researchers observed a dramatic drop in how readily white Americans would express overtly racist ideas in the 1970s and 80s, which called for a paradigm shift in measurement. Meta-analyses are essential for assessing which classes of interventions still 'work' in light of such paradigm shifts. Further, as the credibility revolution spreads across the social sciences [@angrist2010; @samii2016; @vazire2018], we can generally expect recent research to meet comparatively higher standards of rigor and transparency, and therefore have a disproportionate impact on our understanding of the world. Fourth, even in fields with many systematic reviews, there's still often an open lane for a paper that's laser-focused on the findings of the best, most policy-relevant research [@paluck2019] or that's both comprehensive and quantitative [@porat2024; @paluck2021].

### Why meta-analysis and not just a systematic review?

The aims we articulated above could all be met by a non-quantitative systematic review. However, We think that meta-analysis can help illuminate several meta-scientific inferences.

The first is publication bias. Classical approaches to assessing publication bias in meta-analysis are "based on the fact that precision in estimating the underlying treatment effect will increase as the sample size of component studies increases" [@egger1997]. The funnel plot detects publication bias under the assumption that smaller, more imprecisely estimated studies that produce null or backlash results are more likely to be shelved than large, precisely estimated studies that produce the same. (The underlying theory of researcher behavior seems to be a kind of widespread acceptance of the sunk cost fallacy \textemdash that once you've invested the kind of time and energy that a large, rigorous study requires, you'll push through to publication even if you'd put the results back in the 'file drawer' [@rosenthal1979] if you'd put less work in.) Alternatively, one can simply plot the relationship between effect size and standard error, as we did in @paluck2019, where the strong positive relationship between the two suggested that "a very large study would be expected to produce a minuscule *increase* in prejudice." This class of methods requires estimates of effect size and variance for each study. Further, estimates of publication bias can be interesting *between* metas, for instance, the evidence of publication bias that we found in our 2019 and 2021 papers but did not find in @porat2024, which drew more from public health perspectives and departments than did the previous two papers. This kind of evidence can shed light on whether (and how) the credibility revolution is taking hold across disciplines \textemdash a meta-meta-scientific inference.

Second, quantitative estimates allow for head-to-head tests of efficacy across different classes of interventions. For example, @paluck2021 estimated that the "20 experiments testing antibias, multicultural, and moral education programs" have an average effect size of *d* = 0.30, compared to *d* = 0.43 for 12 entertainment interventions. This does not necessarily mean that entertainment interventions reduce prejudice more effectively than antibias trainiings do \textemdash there are many confounding differences between these two categories of study \textemdash but the differences do tell the reader something about how effectively people in different disciplines are manipulating the key quantity of interest by their own lights.

Third, relationships between effect and study quality, measured in a variety of ways, are often illuminating. @paluck2019, for instance, found that studies with pre-analysis plans had an average effect size of 0.016, vs. 0.451 for everything else. This is not a well-identified estimate of the 'effect' of pre-analysis plans \textemdash pre-analysis plans were not randomly assigned, and many other things varied between these studies \textemdash but it is at least a 'hoop test' [@collier2011] for the hypothesis that p-hacking is a problem in the contact hypothesis literature. Likewise, @paluck2021 found a highly significant relationship between meta-analytic effect size and sample sizes, with the smallest quintile of studies producing an average effect of *d* = 0.61 vs *d* = 0.19 for the largest quintile. This is, again, not a well-identified test of the effect of increasing sample size, but it does suggest that the literature's "results are not robust to the most basic assessments of study quality" (p. 149).

Fourth, quantitative estimates allow for assessing differences in effect size between literatures. In general, we don't ascribe any particular meaning to small differences in estimated effect size \textemdash the difference between d = 0.3 vs d = 0.28 might mean something in some disciplines, but given the prevalence of measurement error in the fields we've analyzed [@schmidt1996], we would call this difference insignificant., However, *large* differences between literatures raise some interesting questions. The three meta-analyses discussed in this paper all found overall effect sizes between 0.28 and 0.357: a relatively small range, whereas @green2024, which sets relatively stringent inclusion criteria for both independent and dependent variables, finds an average effect size of 0.131 of interventions intended to reduce consumption of meat and animal products. Again, this is not a well-identified effect; these literatures are different across many dimensions. But the difference in effect sizes between a narrow, selective meta-analysis and its bigger siblings suggests that there are systematic differences between the literatures, and the researchers, that are worth exploring.

We now turn to the pros and cons of these two different approaches in more detail.

## The trade-off between comprehensiveness and narrow, focused reviews

@slough2023 and @simonsohn2022 have raised trenchant critiques about whether the typical meta-analytic estimate is meaningful. Both papers argue that meta-analyses should be more selective in what papers they include \textemdash @slough2023 to assure harmonization of the independent and dependent variables, and @simonsohn2022 to prevent mixing "studies of the highest quality" with "studies that lack internal validity."

Of our three meta-analyses, @paluck2019 most closely hews to this model of inquiry. That paper looked solely at randomized controlled trials where intergroup contact was the treatment variable and where there was at least a day of delay between the commencement of treatment and outcome measurement. (Admittedly we could have tightened our study even further by looking for harmonized dependent variables, but given the diversity of outcomes we found, that would have effectively precluded meta-analysis.) Our subsequent two meta-analyses [@paluck2021; @porat2024], are much more clearly at risk of the kinds of incoherence that recent critics identify. Both studies include a mixture of experiments, quasi-experiments, and observational designs (so long as there was a control group with pre- and post-treatment outcomes); combine papers that are drawing from vastly different theoretical traditions, and mix divergent dependent variables.

Although we haven't seen the issue portrayed in these terms, each of these is a bias-variance trade-off. Conventional meta-analyses consistently resolve this trade-off in favor of reduced variance with only minimal attention to concordant bias. When this challenge *is* discussed, it's typically framed in terms of a desirable trade between internal and external validity {NOTE: cite @roe2009 for now but ultimately we want a quote from a meta about this}, in the sense that what's lost in terms of unbiased causal inference is appropriately compensated for by gains in knowledge about the diversity of settings in which a treatment works.

In general, we do not find this argument persuasive.As @thye2000 puts it, "if there are doubts or questions about whether a relationship is real or spurious, then whether or not the finding applies to other settings is irrelevant" (p. 1303). There is a reasonable counterargument that if randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental/observational designs tend to yield roughly equivalent effect sizes, this would ameliorate concerns about potential confounders or reverse causality in the observational literature. (Indeed, @pettigrew2006 argue this, but as mentioned above, when we re-examined the assembled RCTs, we found them much too scant to say anything definitive.)

Either way, this does not address potential bias introduced by non-harmonized treatments and outcomes. The threat there is not from confounders, but the much more conceptual problem that it simply doesn't make sense to pool what's being pooled. Consider the sexual violence literature, which includes, for instance, a building-based intervention comprising "higher levels of faculty/security presence in safe/unsafe 'hot spots' mapped by students" [@taylor2013], and a module of peer-based consent training on a college campus [@crane2017]. When you average these two things, what does the resulting quantity signify? Ascribing a causal meaning to that average \textemdash saying that both interventions are tests of the same core ideas, just in different settings \textemdash requires some strong additional assumptions. Likewise with dependent variables; in that paper, we coded the Sexual Experiences Survey [@koss1982, @koss1985] for behavioral outcomes and the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale [@thelan2022] for ideas-based outcomes when they were available, but the nearest substitutes for each, in our assessment, when they weren't. What additional assumptions do we need to argue that these multitudinous outcomes are coherently integrable?

We take a different tack: to remove the assumption that a pooled meta-analytic effect should be considered causal. Instead, when we combine studies from heterogeneous designs, treatments, and outcomes, the pooled estimate is a *descriptive* statistic representing the average size of changes measured by a group of researchers, according to them and with outcomes they chose. For @paluck2021, thus number represented the average effects found by prejudice researchers between 2007 and 2019; for @porat2024, the average effects found by sexual violence researchers between 1986 and 2018.

We think there is value in inclusive, comprehensive searches and analyses, even if the overall pooled estimate is not causal. First, the pooled estimate provides a benchmark for all subsequent analyses, including those with sufficient internal validity and harmonization of treatments and outcomes to be plausibly causal. For example, the pooled effect observed in @porat2024 is $\Delta$ = 0.28, but just 0.086 for perpetration outcomes with randomized designs; of the 28 studies meeting these stricter inclusion criteria, 16 self-reported null results. We think this gap between the superficially encouraging results of the literature as a whole and the bleaker results of the best studies looking at the most crucial outcome in the primary prevention literature is a call to action to researchers. Whatever solace they take in the putative effects of the entire literature should be weighed against the scant evidence of change on perpetration outcomes. The contrast helps build the intuition that the literature is in need of a change of direction.

Second, how well different outcomes are harmonized or not is, in some cases, measurable. In @porat2024, we find overall random effects estimates of $\Delta$ = 0.071 for behavioral outcomes and $\Delta$ = 0.366 for ideas-based results. We further tested whether changes in ideas predicted changes in behaviors in studies that measured both, and found a disappointing lack of correlation between the two. This suggests that these classes of outcomes are not fundamentally assessing the same theoretical quantity, and that the paradigm on which this literature is based \textemdash myths about sexual violence cause sexual violence, so changing the myths should reduce the violence \textemdash does not seem to hold. Here, it made more sense to *test* for harmonization than to assume it didn't exist. Even in cases where such analyses aren't viable, researchers can still categorize each point estimate by its class of dependent variable and analyze the results separately.

Third, coding a wide variety of interventions allows for subsequent analyses to focus on the effects of particular interventions, or classes of intervention, and comparing them to each other. Again, the overall meta-analytic estimate provides a backdrop to these more focused analyses.

Fourth, starting from a precise estimate, gleaned from hundreds of studies, and then moving to a much higher quality but sparser dataset of the very best studies is an effective narrative device. Consider the contrast provided by @pettigrew2006 and @paluck2019. The former study observes that across hundreds of studies and hundreds of thousands of people that contact typically reduces prejudice. The latter study, however, notes that as of 2018, there had been zero studies studying interracial contact in adults that had both random assignment and a delay of at least a single day between the beginning of treatment and outcome measurement. In other words, some essential basic research was missing. Here, we thiink the apparent solidity of the first claim makes the second all the more startling.

In sum, we see value to identifying, coding, and heterogeneous estimates from study designs, interventions, and outcomes. However, a focused meta-analysis with strict inclusion criteria can also have appreciable impact on the field. So when is one straetgy or the other appropriate?

We favor comprehensive meta-analyses if resources allow. These projects are much more labor-intensive and time-consuming: @paluck2019 was basically written in a summer by three people, whereas @porat2024 took six years, five authors, and a team of RAs. (Admittedly the pandemic didn't help.) However, there are two main reasons to strive for comprehensiveness. The first is to develop, and then impart to readers, as thorough an understanding of an underlying literature as possible. For example, for our review of main ideas and zeitgeist studies in "The Leading Approach to Reducing Sexual Violence" in @porat2024, there is simply no substitute for reading hundreds of studies. (We'd also add that quantitative coding studies is a kind of enforcement mechanism for reading a paper closely.) Second, a more focused analysis of the very best studies can be encompassed within a comprehensive meta-analysis. For example, the dataset assembled in @paluck2021 could (hypothetically) be filtered to reproduce the dataset of @paluck2019 precisely, but the revers, of course, is not true.

However, a more focused meta-analysis can still be a very useful contribution, especially as a rejoinder to prior credulous reviews.

We now turn to the pragmatic sections of our paper, where we detail the typical structure of our meta-analytic papers, our analytic defaults, and an R package that implements those defaults. 

## Typical structure of Paluck lab meta-analytic papers

1.  Describe context and stakes of the paper (i.e. why it's important to see if these interventions 'work', or why there is reason to doubt an established consensus)
2.  Intellectual overview of major ideas in the literature
3.  descriptive statistics and/or qualitative overview about the database
    1.  Contact hypothesis: what, where, why
    2.  Prejudice reduction: theoretical perspectives, landmark studies
    3.  Sexual violence paper: history of zeitgeist perspectives
4.  Evaluate rather than transcribe
5.  Meta-analytic search methods
6.  Meta-analytic approach6
7.  Quantitative Results
8.  Discussion, highlights and gaps
    i.  We identify high points (excellent studies) and low points (widespread methodological deficiencies), like simonsohn et al call for
    ii. place effect sizes in context of real-world impact whenever possible, e.g. the prejudice paper argues that $\Delta$ of 0.27 corresponds to [X] change on ANES survey
    iii. As our reviews show, applying some fairly minimal quality standards quickly winnows hundreds of studies down to just a few

## Paluck lab meta-analytic procedures

1.  Code more than you think you're going to need
    1.  You might be interested in the lasting effects, which means recording the latest possible effect sizes, but if you record the *earliest* possible effects, you can detect within-study decay
2.  Start big and then go small, like a funnel; i.e. meta-analyze *everything* and then zoom in on different subsets of the literature 5. Test for publication bias should probably look at absolutely everything 6. Inter-paper comparisons; Paluck, Green and Green (2019) and Paluck et al. (2021) provide estimates of about $\Delta$ = 0.3, and then Green, Smith and Mathur (forthcoming) find $\Delta$ = 0.138, which also means something.
3.  Do some serious tests for publication bias: both conventional tests (egger's test, funnel plot, $\Delta$ \~ SE), but also think through where else it might emerge, e.g. compare effect sizes in studies with and without DOIs
4.  separate the dataset into different chunks, e.g. by theory, study design, or measurement strategy, and present these meta-analytic estimates side by side
    1.  Subset enough and eventually you get to reasonable claim for contrast and mechanism harmony (Slough and Tyson 2022)
5.  Zoom in on and carefully and analyze best studies, both in aggregate and individually
    1.  These results might be surprising, e.g. when looking solely at RCTs on perpetration outcomes [@porat2024], slightly fewer than half are self-reported nulls.
6.  Meta-analytic defaults
    1.  Random effects: any literature we want to look at is going to have heterogeneous inputs.
    2.  Cluster at level of study
    3.  Glass's $\Delta$ rather than Cohen's d
    4.  Difference in proportion rather than odds ratio
        1.  resurface text from appendix to Porat et al. (2024)

## R package: blp_meta_functions

1.  Functions fall into four categories
    1.  Converting studies to singular estimates of effect size, variance and standard error
    2.  Wrapper functions that distill aggregate results into the core findings and make them table-ready
    3.  plotting functions
    4.  Miscellany: reproducibility, helper functions

## Conclusions: hard cases

A classic paper on meta-analysis defines the procedure as "a statistical analysis which combines or integrates the results of several independent clinical trials considered by the analyst to be ‘combinable'" (p. XXX). Our (non-systematic) review of prior meta-analyses reveals a surprising dearth of attention to how much theoretical work is being done by the phrase "considered by the analyst to be 'combinable.'" @simonsohn2022 argue that researchers who "uncritically" aggregate results from all available studies, as part of an "active effort to eliminate publication bias...might instead amplify the bias from poor research design and execution." We agree with this assessment, but would instead frame it as one of three central instances of a bias-variance tradeoff afflicting meta-analayses. By combining studies with non-comparable designs, interventions, and outcomes, researchers give readers the impression of remarkable precision (re: reduced variance) but at the expense of introducing non-statistical sources of uncertainty (re: bias) on all three fronts. Only by acknowledging these tradeoffs head-on, and devising interpretations and techniques for dealing with them, can we successfully integrate the parallel tracks of meta-analysis and meta-science.

More broadly, this paper seeks to answer two questions: what are we aiming to do when we do meta-analysis, and how do we do it? We that that we've answered these questions to some extent, but many open questions remain. To us, the most pressing boil down to a lack of clarity about whether meta-analyses are or are not hypothesis-driven. Other meta-analyses in the social sciences are clearly aimed at validating a pre-existing hypothesis. Ours, however, are more exploratory, and as befitting our meta-scientific framework, are more aimed at evaluating a literature's credibility. While we might start with some general hypotheses \textemdash e.g. that a social psychology literature from the 2000s is likely to show evidence of selection pressures for statistical significance \textemdash we also develop many of our most important questions after reading papers, which, in the context of writing a meta-analysis, means after data collection has begun. In other words, our meta-analyses are both inductive and deductive inquiries.

This makes writing a pre-analysis plan challenging. Consider a mistake we made while composing the pre-analysis plan for @porat2024. Because we are accustomed to social psychology literatures, we registered the analysis that we would "Evaluate the overall effect size of behavioral outcomes for all of the studies in the dataset, both in the short- and in the long-term." The idea was to measure if effects of interventions attenuate over time, which is a serious concern in psychology. However, what we failed to think through is that while some behavioral outcomes in the sexual violence literature could be measured immediately (e.g. whether someone volunteers for a campus rape education organization [@gillies1997]), most behavioral outcomes in the sexual violence literature need time to accumulate. The Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) measures incidents of sexual violence in a given time period, and an SES administered at the end of a semester was essentially guaranteed to have more incidents than one given immediately after an intervention concluded. This only became clear to us after we began reading papers (though someone more expert than we are could have seen it coming).

The way we resolved this was to make sure that we included, either in the paper or in an appendix, every single pre-registered analysis, even when they were not especially informative. Moving forward, we aim to have pre-specified analysis code run on simulated data [@broockman2016; @blair2019]. However, this is still a work in progress at our lab.

Second, we sometimes encounter methodological errors, or simple implausibilities, in the literature that are difficult to integrate into formal inclusion and exclusion criteria. Should we exclude a study because it has an implausibly *large* effect size, e.g. a t-test value of 36? (One study in the prejudice reduction literature did.) What about errors in the text, or obvious discrepancies between results reported in the text and those in a table? What about a lack of transparent reporting that leads to our spending hours guessing a study's true effects? Each of these is information about a study's true quality; as @simonsohn2022 argue, excluding these studies would be "kind of meritocratic screening of research" that we "engage in when performing virtually every other task in [our] professional research lives."

There are clearly no easy answers to this problem, and we've developed general guidelines as we've progressed. One is that cluster RCTs with fewer than 10 clusters in total are so underpowered that they are effectively quasi-experiments, and we code them as such. Another is that we do not code studies where we need to eyeball a figure to assess effect sizes: researchers must tell us flat out how big an effect was. Likewise, we do not include "the results were significant" or simply "p \< .05." However, if authors tell us that a result was "null" or "not significant" but do not tell us anything more, we set the result to be *d* = 0.01. These rules are not perfect, but ultimately, we need policies that balance type I errors (including a study we shouldn't) and type II errors (excluding studies we should have included). Like research itself, we suspect that this task is not perfectible.

Last, there is a great deal of subjectivity in figuring out what outcomes to code. For @porat2024, we found relative homogeneity of dependent variables, but not so for @paluck2019 or @paluck2021. In the end,this has always been a judgment call, but as we continue writing meta-analyses, we hope to develop principled, general guidelines for this kind of analytic choice.

These open questions notwithstanding, we think meta-analyses can be useful, informative, and a pleasure to write and read. We hope to see them become a standard part of the meta-scientist's toolkit, and likewise for all meta-analyses to become a little more meta-scientific.
