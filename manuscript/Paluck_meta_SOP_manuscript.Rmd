  This paper describes the motivations and procedures for meta-analyses by Betsy Levy Paluck and co-authors, with reference and examples drawn from three such papers (Paluck, Green, and Green 2019, Paluck et al. 2021, and Gantman et al. 2024). We first describe our conceptual aims when writing meta-analytic papers, which are to provide an 'on-ramp' to interested readers, to evaluate a literature's strengths and weaknesses, and to illuminate empirical gaps, which we intend as signposts for future researchers. Second, we describe the typical 'flow' of the papers as a whole. Third, we describe our meta-analytic procedures, detailing our default reporting structure and analytic choices and engaging with recent critiques from Slough and Tyson (2022) and Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson (2022). Fourth, we introduce a collection of functions we use to implement our meta-analytic choices, available as an R package. Fifth, we conclude with some open questions for meta-analysts.

##  Introduction: [phrase]

What purposes do meta-analyses serve above and beyond those met by systematic reviews? Judging by recent papers in social psychology [@pettigrew2006, @bem2015, @cuddy2018, @bezrukova2016], the answer is to bolster and validate existing findings through aggregation. By pooling findings from many studies, researchers furnish meta-analytic estimates that are typically heartening to a literature's boosters by dint of their statistical precision and suggestion of broad applicability across settings. Such papers often have a valedictory quality to them: they provide leading practitioners a chance to survey the body of work they've helped inspire, highlight the strength of the evidence for their subfield's central tenets, and suggest future research directions that assume those tenets are no longer in need of further testing.

Meanwhile, a parallel movement in psychology has begun to implement the findings and suggestions of the open science [@nosek2015] and meta-science [@schooler2014] movements into study designs [@ferguson2023], journal policies [@hardwicke2023transparency], and literature reviews [@hardwicke2018]. Some of those reviews provide quantitative assessments of meta-scientific quantitites, for instance, what percentage of a subset of papers are computationally reproducible [@obels2020] or consistent with open data standards [@hardwicke2021].  In some sense, these estimates are meta-analytic, but they aren't meta-analyses in the conventional sense of pooling existing findings into weighted average effects [@glass1977, @kleinstauber1996, @cooper2019]. In tone, these papers are often much more critical than meta-analyses are, and they are often written by outsiders or newcomers to an academic field rather than leading experts. Thus, though they share part of their name, the meta-analytic and meta-scientific tradition generally bring very different starting assumptions, use different tools, and are fundamentally written by and aimed at different audiences: from insider to insiders vs. outsiders to everyone.

At the Paluck lab, we seek to synthesize these two approaches by writing meta-analyses that are fundamentally meta-scientific. Over the course of four systematic reviews, three with meta-analytic components [@paluck2009, @paluck2019, @paluck2021, @gantman2024], we've developed and honed somewhat idiosyncratic beliefs about where and when a meta-analysis is useful, how to structure our meta-analytic arguments, and default specifications. This paper articulates those beliefs, and aims to illuminate how  meta-analysis might become a standard part of the meta-scientist's toolkit. 

First, we describe the conditions when a meta-analysis adds something above and beyond a systematic review. We believe that meta-analyses are useful for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of large, heterogeneous literatures, especially those that bring multiple theoretical perspectives to bear. They can also be useful for providing focused re-examination of a literature's main findings as a contrast to previous credulous reviews. Contrary to critics who argue that core assumptions about homogeneity across experimental contrasts and outcomes are necessary for the standard meta-analytic model to hold [@slough2022], we think that comprehensive, heterogeneous meta-analyses can still be useful when these conditions aren't met; in such cases, meta-analytic estimates should be treated as _descriptive_ rather than _causal_ inferences. Moreover, we see value in contrasting all-inclusive estimates, which are fundamentally descriptive, to more rigorous, focused estimates, which come about by imposing additional structure on which studies and outcomes are pooled and which are fundamentally causal. The contrasts in magnitude and precision between these two approaches are often startling and illuminating.

Next, we describe the typical structure of the meta-analysis sections of our papers. In general, we start big and go small, meaning that we first start with meta-analytic estimates, as well as tests for publication bias, in the entire literature. 
### Meta-analysis at 50: from social to medical science and back again

- Since the term was first coined in 1976 [@glass1976], meta-analysis has come to be understood as a crucial tool for synthesizing evidence in the medical and natural sciences (citation)

- core idea, as a 1990 NYT article put put it, is to allow researchers "to draw more reliable inferences or new conclusions from the combined results than from smaller studies that may be inconclusive individually" [@altman1990]
- labeled as controversial in that article, but the examples are all from medicine. then [debated vigorously in 2012](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/science/stanford-organic-food-study-and-vagaries-of-meta-analyses.html)
- take an excellent conventional meta-analysis, e.g. @meremikwu2012. This study looks at Intermittent Preventive Treatment for malaria in seven trials, with  12,589 subjects,all of which  "were conducted in West Africa, and six of seven trials were restricted to children aged less than 5 years." The study finds that IPT leads to significant reductions in both malaria cases and severe malaria cases, "a small reduction in all‐cause mortality," and that "drug‐related adverse events, if they occur, are probably rare." 
- Note four qualities of this meta-analysis:
    1. All RCTs
    2. Singular,cohesive treatment
    3. Seven different draws from a common population
    4. Coherent, commonly measured outcomes that clearly represent key quantities of interest
In the past 20 years, meta-analysis has become much more common in the social sciences and in psychological science in particular.  But if we look at some prominent ones, we might say that these conditions of the "ideal" meta-analysis don't really hold. 
    1. Methodological diversity (Pettigrew and Tropp 2006 integrate studies of widely different designs)
    2. Very diverse treatments (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-43598-001)
    3. Diverse settings (cite example)
    4. Broad array of outcome measures (Paluck et al. 2020)
    
### Contemporary criticisms of meta-analysis from meta-scientists
Recent papers have raised the possibility that the core assumptions of meta-analysis are often not met in contemporary work.

Slough and Tyson (2022) argue that two core conditions are necessary for meta-analysis to make sense: contrast and target harmonization...

Meanwhile, Simonsohn et al (SSN). argue...

These critiques register deeply with us because of our three recent meta-analyses, two strive to be comprehensive and therefore arguably do not meet the assumptions laid out by Slough and Tyson and are guilty of the sins identified by SSN (though SSN also identify one of papers as exemplary)

So does meta-analysis still _work_ under these conditions? Is there something cogent and meaningful here? 

### All models are wrong, but this one is still useful 

We say yes, we still think meta-analysis can be useful even if the underlying literatures do not meet the ideal conditions of a medical literature, with the qualification that meta-analytic estimates need to be presented and  contextualized appropriately. We urge researchers not to throw the baby out with the bathwater -- as always, all models are wrong, but we think this one is useful. 

This article outlines how we make our meta-analyses useful, and to whom. We start by identifying what makes a literature a good candidate for meta-analysis, our overarching purposes when we write one, and who we write such pieces for. We then describe our typical paper structure for a meta-analysis; our default analytic choices; and an R package, `PaluckMetaSOP`, that implements our defaults and helps aids our writing process. We conclude with some open questions and hard cases

[where does this go] this piece also contributes to two burgeoning literatures:
    SOPs ([https://alexandercoppock.com/Green-Lab-SOP/Green_Lab_SOP.pdf](https://alexandercoppock.com/Green-Lab-SOP/Green_Lab_SOP.pdf), [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~winston/sop-safety-net.pdf](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~winston/sop-safety-net.pdf)) + ones Don cited
    establishing theoretical underpinnings of meta-analysis (Slough and Tyson, SSN, Gechter and Meager)
also munger 2023
- metaketas (slough et al) and psych science accelerator? Those pieces are meta but in a different way.

#### Notes
    
1. Meta-analyses are common in the social sciences – cite some big ones.
2. And yet, meta-analyses are surprisingly undertheorized.
    1. Most of the guides for meta-analysis are aimed at medical doctors and researchers and presume that you contrast and target harmonization (Slough and Tyson 2022) – in other words, that the “X” and the “Y” in “does X influence Y?” are basically the same across studies, and the goal is just to average their results.
        1. Sometimes that holds, e.g. [deworming](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kremer/files/meta-analysis_deworming_world_bank_working_paper_dec_2016.pdf) or [insecticide-treated bednets](https://www.mmv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/access/SMC_Tool_Kit/publications/Meremikww-ipt-review.pdf)
        2. But in the behavioral sciences, the inputs are probably a lot more heterogeneous, e.g. [diversity](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-43598-001) [training](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spc3.12741?af=R) or [the](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16737372/) [contact](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-07056-001) [hypothesis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1088868318762647), as are the outputs, as are the outputs, e.g. a mix of attitudinal and behavioral outcomes and sometimes totally bespoke instruments.
        3. Looking at [the Cochrane Review](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10), we see guidelines that are thorough, but generally propose statistical solutions to what are fundamentally non-statistical sources of uncertainty. By contrast, [Simmonsohn et al. (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-022-00101-8) argue for _design_-based solutions. 
    2. Over the course of 8 years and three meta-analyses, we’ve developed a distinct perspective about when to do meta-analysis, what it’s useful for, and how to do it. This article articulates that perspective. 
    3. SOPs ([https://alexandercoppock.com/Green-Lab-SOP/Green_Lab_SOP.pdf](https://alexandercoppock.com/Green-Lab-SOP/Green_Lab_SOP.pdf), [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~winston/sop-safety-net.pdf](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~winston/sop-safety-net.pdf))
4. So when are meta-analyses useful? 


## When are meta-analyses useful and value do they bring?


###  When do we do meta-analyses?



1. Our lab embarks on meta-analyses when
    1. Big literature with heterogeneous research quality
    5. Multiple theoretical approaches whose comparative efficacy is unknown 
    6. Intuition that a comprehensive read through and tests for rigor will reveal collective gaps in understanding
2. Alternatively, if someone else has already written a comprehensive review, there might be room for a focused rejoinder, i.e. Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) amalgamate everything and find large effects, whereas Paluck Green and Green (2019) look at just the best studies and find much more mixed results.


### What purposes do they serve?



1. On-ramp to unfamiliar literature (alternate metaphor: "a lobby," from Toni Morrison's introduction to Beloved), exemplified by
    1. Contact hypothesis: what, where, why
    2. iii. Prejudice reduction: theoretical perspectives, landmark studies
    3. iv. Sexual violence paper: history of zeitgeist perspectives
2. Evaluate rather than transcribe
    4. Describe critique of transcriptive, non-evaluative work in Simonsohn et al. (2022)
    5. We identify high points (excellent studies) and low points (widespread methodological deficiencies) 
    6. place effect sizes in context of real-world impact whenever possible, e.g. the prejudice paper argues that $\Delta$ of 0.27 corresponds to [X] change on ANES survey
3. Illuminate empirical gaps
    7. As our reviews show, applying some fairly minimal quality standards quickly winnows hundreds of studies down to just a few
    8. These studies are likely to be the  most policy-relevant, and oftentimes the 'ideal' study simply hasn't been conducted at all yet
    9. Examples: 
        1. Paluck, Green and Green (2019) highlight lack of studies testing interracial contact among adults -> provide intellectual backdrop for Scacco and Warren (2018), Mousa (2020), and Lowe (2019) -- as well as providing theoretical underpinning for those studies' comparatively underwhelming findings
        2 similar examples from Paluck et al. (2021)? 
        3. (arguably a systematic review suffices for this)

### Who are they for?
1. researchers, especially folks trying to figure out where they can have the most impact
2. policymakers and funders who want a critical review of a literature
3. any interested reader. Our metas tend to be about big, important subjects that people are thinking about. 
## Typical structure of Paluck lab meta-analytic papers



1. Describe context and stakes of the paper (i.e. why it's important to see if these interventions 'work', or why there’s reason to doubt an established consensus)
2. Intellectual overview of major ideas in the literature
3. Meta-analytic search methods 
4. Meta-analytic approach
5. Quantitative Results
6. Discussion, highlights and gaps
7. Conclusion


## Paluck lab meta-analytic procedures



1. Code more than you think you're going to need
    1. You might be interested in the lasting effects, which means recording the latest possible effect sizes, but if you record the _earliest_ possible effects, you can detect within-study decay
2. Start big and then go small, like a funnel; i.e. meta-analyze *everything* and then zoom in on different subsets of the literature
    2. Why meta-analyze everything?	
        1. Slough and Tyson (2023) argue that meta-analytic estimates only make sense if there's contrast harmony, i.e. if the many studies are clearly testing some common underlying theoretical concept. In some literatures we've looked at, this pretty clearly does not hold, e.g. the average effect of a contact hypothesis field experiment for Muslims and Christians and Nigeria and a diversity training in a U.S. corporate workplace tells you the combined effect of *what* exactly? 
        2.  Ditto with "target harmony", which is whether interventions are aimed *at* changing the same thing. For instance, does it make sense to average the effect of some intervention on self-reported attitudes and behavioral outcomes? As Gantman et al. (2023) show, these outcomes are not always well correlated, which is prima facie evidence that we don't have target harmony.
        3. Last, integrating observational and randomized studies is often justified as supplementing high studies with high internal validity with studies with high *external* validity, but it's probably more accurate to say that you take some studies that provide unbiased estimates and then, in exchange for greater statistical precision, induce bias arising from non-statistical sources of uncertainty ([Gerber, Green and Kaplan 2004](http://www.donaldgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Gerber-Green-Kaplan-IllusionofLearning.pdf)).
    3. multi-part answer.
        4. Overall meta-analytic estimate provides a within-paper size comparison; your overall effect size is X and your effect size for the very best studies is 1/3 X, that means something.
        5. Test for publication bias should probably look at absolutely everything
        6. Inter-paper comparisons; Paluck, Green and Green (2019) and Paluck et al. (2021) provide estimates of about $\Delta$ = 0.3, and then Green, Smith and Mathur (forthcoming) find $\Delta$ = 0.138, which also means something.
3. Do some serious tests for publication bias: both conventional tests (egger's test, funnel plot, $\Delta$ ~ SE), but also think through where else it might emerge, e.g. compare effect sizes in studies with and without DOIs
4. separate the dataset into different chunks, e.g. by theory, study design, or measurement strategy, and present these meta-analytic estimates side by side
    4. Subset enough and eventually you get to reasonable claim for contrast and mechanism harmony (Slough and Tyson 2022)
5.  Zoom in on and carefully and analyze best studies, both in aggregate and individually
    5. These results might be surprising, e.g. when looking solely at RCTs on perpetration outcomes (Gantman et al. 2024), slightly fewer than half are self-reported nulls.
6. Meta-analytic defaults
    6. Random effects: any literature we want to look at is going to have heterogeneous inputs. 
    7. Cluster at level of study
    8. Glass's $\Delta$ rather than Cohen's d
    9. Difference in proportion rather than odds ratio
        7. resurface text from appendix to Gantman et al. (2024)


## R package: blp_meta_functions



1. Functions fall into four categories
    1. Converting studies to singular estimates of effect size, variance and standard error
    2. Wrapper functions that distill aggregate results into the core findings and make them table-ready
    3. plotting functions
    4. Miscellany: reproducibility, helper functions

## Conclusions: hard cases

1. What do we do when a paper's results are obviously not credible? 
    1. e.g. if they present a result that's well past possible, e.g. t-test value of 36 (one of the papers in the prejudice literature had this, and also the cost-benefit analyses in the SOSA! Intervention in the primary prevention literature)
2. What's the right outcome to code? Often very unclear what's prime or most representative of underlying construct
3. Others...
4. Meta-analyses are still very useful, we think, for readers (both expert and non-expert) and future researchers.
