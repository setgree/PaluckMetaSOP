\subsection{Introduction: the divergent approaches of meta-analysis and meta-science}\label{introduction-the-divergent-approaches-of-meta-analysis-and-meta-science}

What purposes do meta-analyses serve above and beyond those accomplished by systematic reviews? Judging by recent papers in social psychology (Bem, Tressoldi, Rabeyron, \& Duggan, 2015; Bezrukova, Spell, Perry, \& Jehn, 2016; Cuddy, Schultz, \& Fosse, 2018; Pettigrew \& Tropp, 2006), the answer is to bolster and validate existing findings through aggregation. By pooling findings from many studies, researchers furnish meta-analytic estimates that are typically heartening to a literature's boosters because they are statistically precise and drawn from diverse settings, which gives readers the impression of durable, widely applicable findings. Such papers often have a valedictory quality to them: they provide leading practitioners a chance to survey the body of work they've helped inspire, highlight the strength of the evidence for their subfield's central tenets, and suggest future research directions that assume those tenets are no longer in need of testing.

Meanwhile, a parallel movement in psychology has begun to implement the findings and suggestions of the open science (Nosek, 2015) and meta-science (Schooler, 2014) movements into study designs (Ferguson et al., 2023), journal policies (Hardwicke \& Vazire, 2023), and literature reviews (Hardwicke et al., 2018). Some of those reviews quantitatively assess meta-scientific outcomes, for instance, what percentage of a subset of papers are computationally reproducible (Obels, Lakens, Coles, Gottfried, \& Green, 2020) or consistent with open data standards (Hardwicke et al., 2021). In some sense, these estimates are meta-analytic, but they aren't meta-analyses in the conventional sense of pooling existing findings into weighted average effects (Cooper, Hedges, \& Valentine, 2019; Glass, 1977; Kleinstäuber et al., 1996). In tone, meta-science papers are often much more critical than meta-analyses are, and they are often written by outsiders or newcomers to an academic field who appear more motivated to interrogate than to validate. Thus, despite the superficial similarity of the terms, meta-analytic and meta-scientific papers in social psychology typically have radically different perspectives, assumptions, and goals.

At the Paluck lab, we seek to synthesize these two approaches by writing meta-analyses that are fundamentally meta-scientific. Over the course of four systematic reviews, three with meta-analytic components (Paluck \& Green, 2009; Paluck, Green, \& Green, 2019; Paluck, Porat, Clark, \& Green, 2021; Porat, Gantman, Paluck, Green, \& Pezzuto, 2024), we've developed distinct beliefs about where and when a meta-analysis is useful, how to structure the meta-analytic sections of our systematic reviews, and which specifications are sensible defaults. This paper articulates those beliefs, and aims to illuminate how meta-analysis might become a standard component of the meta-scientific toolkit.

First, we describe the conditions when a meta-analysis adds something above and beyond a systematic review. We believe that meta-analyses are useful for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of large, heterogeneous literatures, especially those that bring multiple theoretical perspectives to bear. They can also be useful for providing focused re-examination of a literature's main findings as a contrast to previous credulous reviews. Contrary to critics who argue that core assumptions about homogeneity across experimental contrasts and outcomes are necessary for the standard meta-analytic model to hold (Slough \& Tyson, 2023), we think that comprehensive, heterogeneous meta-analyses can still be useful when these conditions aren't met; in such cases, meta-analytic estimates should be treated as \emph{descriptive} rather than \emph{causal} inferences. Moreover, we see value in contrasting all-inclusive estimates, which are fundamentally descriptive, to more rigorous, focused estimates, which, because they reflect strict selection criteria related to study design and outcome measurement, are more plausibly causal. The within-paper contrast in magnitude and precision between these two approaches is often startling and illuminating.

Next, we describe the typical structure of our meta-analytic papers. In general, we start by describing the main ideas and trends in a literature, which provides readers an `onramp' into the field's major findings and concerns. Our papers then describe our search processes and meta-analytic methods, followed by our meta-analytic findings. These analyses are structured to start big and go small, meaning that we first present meta-analytic estimates and tests for publication bias for the entire literature and then hone in on key quantities of interest from smaller subsets of the data. For instance, in a literature with randomized controlled trials, quasi-experiments, and observational designs, as well as a mix of attitudinal and behavioral outcomes, we might first present an overall meta-analytic effect, and then present a 3 by 2 table where each subset of study design + outcome strategy gets its own meta-analytic estimate. Alternatively, in a literature with many similar but distinct quantities of interest, e.g.~racial/ethnic prejudice vs.~prejudice against LGBTQ+ people vs.~prejudice against people with physical and mental disabilities, we would present the meta-analytic effects within each subset of data. Our concluding investigations tend to probe differences in effect size by some marker of study quality, e.g.~the presence of a pre-analysis plan, or the relationship between effect sizes within studies, e.g.~if attitudinal changes tends to predict behavioral changes.

Third, we detail our meta-analytic defaults. For instance, we use a random effects model, as implemented by the \texttt{metafor} package in R (Viechtbauer, 2010), rather than a fixed effects (sometimes called an equal effects) model, and we cluster our analyses at the level of an individual study. Further, we prefer Glass's \(\Delta\) to Cohen's \emph{d} so as to avoid an additional assumption about the effects of treatment on the underlying distribution of outcomes. Here, we also detail a novel estimator for converting difference in proportion to an effect size that has some desirable properties relative to the conventional conversion from an odds ratio (Gomila, 2021).

Fourth, we introduce an R package, \texttt{PaluckMetaSOP}, that contains functions to help us quickly and efficiently perform meta-analyses. We describe the main categories of function and provide brief usage examples.

Finally, we conclude by noting some open questions for meta-scientific meta-analyses. While we tend to begin meta-analytic projects with a sense of what's true and what's interesting, in practice, the most incisive questions often emerge after reading and coding studies, i.e.~after data collection has begun. In other words, meta-analyses are both \emph{hypothesis\_driven} (re: deductive) and \emph{data-driven} (re: inductive); However, typical checks on researcher degrees of freedom assume a hypothesis-driven framework. This makes it tricky to ``tie one's hands to the mast'' (Elster, 1977), e.g., by writing a detailed pre-analysis plan and pre-specifying which outcomes to focus on. We describe how we've dealt with such issues so far and how we think to improve going forward. Last, we discuss the difficulty of integrating indirect cues of study quality, e.g.~obviously mistaken statistical results or special attention devoted to reproducibility, into our analyses in a principled way.

Previous papers have noted potential pitfalls for meta-analysts (e.g. Greco, Zangrillo, Biondi-Zoccai, and Landoni (2013)), detailed common statistical errors in their application (Kadlec, Sainani, \& Nimphius, 2023), or noted that they are often not computationally reproducible (Daniel Lakens et al., 2017). This paper sits in that tradition, but is a bit of an offshoot in that we are not attempting to correct statistical or practical mistakes in meta-analyses, but rather articulate what it is that we are trying to do when we write them. In this regard, this paper is closely in dialogue with two recent papers that attempt to put meta-analysis on firmer theoretical footing. Slough and Tyson (2023) ``highlight the dangers of conflating conceptual differences across studies with statistical sources of variation'' (p.~29). They argue that for studies to ``identify the same empirical target'' (p.~1), they must have fundamentally \emph{harmonized} contrasts and measurement strategies, i.e.~the ``substantive comparison across studies is the same'' and ``the outcome of interest is the same and it is measured in the same way'' (p.~2). Absent these conditions, meta-analytic results might not be ``meaningful and interpretable'' (p.~2). Contrary to conventional approaches to improving the accuracy of meta-analyses, a lack of target equivalence cannot be ``solved solely with statistical techniques'' (p.~23). Rather, it is more likely to be achieved through ``design or inclusion criteria'' (p.~2).

We agree that an internally and externally valid causal meta-analytic estimate requires harmonization of contrasts and outcomes (as well as a high degree of internal validity within constituent studies). However, we also think that meta-analytic estimates which do \emph{not} meet these conditions \textemdash e.g.~those that combine results from many different designs, or whose diverse outcomes bear an unknown relationship to the true outcome of interest \textemdash can still be useful and informative if interpreted and framed correctly. We think that when a literature without clear harmony of the independent and dependent variables is a case where the underlying model might be ``wrong'' but still useful.

The other paper in this vein we look to is Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson (2022), who argue that while the typical meta-analysis in social psychology aims ``to be comprehensive, results-focused and transcriptive,'' this is ``misguided, leading to uninterpretable results that misrepresent research literatures.'' First, they argue that a desire for comprehensiveness typically leads the meta-analyst to average ``studies of the highest quality'' with ``studies that lack internal validity or external validity, which are obtained using incorrect statistical techniques, or studies where results seem to arise from methodological artefacts.'' This throw-it-all-in-the-blender approach produces results that are ``virtually guaranteed to lack a meaningful interpretation,'' despite their putative statistical precision. Second, the authors encourage meta-analysts to focus on studies' designs, rather than just their results, to provide ``readers with information that they can use to evaluate'' the quality of a research literature for themselves. Rather than describing every study, meta-analysts ``can succinctly describe and summarize common design failures\ldots and provide detailed descriptions only of the studies they deem most important or compelling.'' This advice ties closely to their last dictum to meta-analysts: to evaluate rather than to transcribe, i.e., detail the evidence from the very best studies, identify common methodological shortcomings of the literature as a whole, and, finally, ``discuss what open questions remain and what kinds of evidence would help answer those questions.''

Our meta-analyses share these goals (and Paluck et al. (2021) is cited therein for being ``selective, design-focused, and evaluative''). Moreover, the authors note that typical guides to meta-analysis ``briefly mention validity concerns but provide little guidance as to how to carry out quality control;'' one of the aims of this paper is to provide such guidance. However, as mentioned above, we part ways from this paper in that we believe comprehensive meta-analytic estimates still have a place in the meta-scientist's toolkit, so long as those estimates are ascribed descriptive rather than causal meaning and are used to contextualize further, more selective analyses.

Our paper is a hybrid of a conceptual analysis of meta-analyses in general and a report on how we in particular write them. On the latter front, this paper builds on a tradition of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in the behavioral and medical sciences (D. Lakens, 2023; Rapport et al., 2013; Wallace et al., 2015). In particular, we look to Lin and Green (2016), which details how the Green lab at Columbia sets ``default practices to guide decisions when issues arise that were not anticipated in'' pre-analysis plans. Like that paper, this article is not intended as a comprehensive guide to the task in question \textemdash see Cumpston et al. (2019) and Cooper et al. (2019) for textbook-length treatments of meta-analysis, and Frank et al. (2024), chapter 16, Daniel Lakens (2022), chapter 11 and Slough and Tyson (forthcoming), chapter 5 for modern treatments of the subject aimed at social scientists. Rather, we articulate our lab's admittedly idiosyncratic approach to a task that many research groups embark on. We hope this will prove interesting and informative, but not definitive: we expect readers to adapt and expand our guidelines to meet their own needs. In general, we hope to see more labs publish papers about how they produce knowledge.

We now detail our conceptual aims when we write meta-analyses.

\subsection{Meta-analyses: when, how and for whom}\label{meta-analyses-when-how-and-for-whom}

\subsubsection{Our overarching agenda}\label{our-overarching-agenda}

The main goals of our meta-analysis are the goals of any systematic review: to evaluate a body of knowledge for its strengths, weaknesses, central findings, open questions and empirical limitations. We write broadly for any reader who is interested in the underlying question, but generally aim for a non-specialist audience. In our experience, a literature's most noteworthy contributions often come from researchers outside the core field (e.g. Mousa (2020), Boisjoly, Duncan, Kremer, Levy, and Eccles (2006), or Scacco and Warren (2018) for the contact hypothesis, Munger (2017) for anti-prejudice work, or Haushofer, Ringdal, Shapiro, and Wang (2019) for violence against women); to such researchers, we aim to provide signposts, in the form of unearthed, widespread empirical gaps and theoretical limitations, about where future empirical work will be most valuable. We also believe that funders and policymakers will generally benefit from systematic, critical reviews that do not take subject matter expertise for granted.

In general, large, heterogeneous literatures, especially those with multiple theoretical perspectives, are good candidates for meta-analysis. In such cases, a meta-analysis might provide a useful contribution simply by dividing a literature into its constituent parts. For example, Paluck et al. (2021) categorizes 418 experiments published between 2007 and 2019 and organizes them into thirteen theoretical approaches and twelve categories of prejudice targeted. Simply identifying this heterogeneity of approaches and outcomes, along with describing a few constituent studies from the major theoretical strands in detail, helps the reader evaluate a literature's major findings for herself. In this particular case, a reader might reasonably wonder: is an extended contact intervention (Shamoa-Nir \& Razpurker-Apfeld, 2023) similar enough to a diversity training (Chang et al., 2019) that you can pool the effects together into something that coherently reflects the effects of a class of intervention? Likewise, does intervention that aims to change political attitudes towards the rights of trans persons (Broockman \& Kalla, 2016) shed light on what might reduce tensions between castes in India (Lowe, 2021)? These questions come down to beliefs, and, as Slough and Tyson (2023) argue, cannot be resolved with statistics. A comprehensive and well-organized review is an indispensable tool for clarifying which questions to ask in the first place.

We also encourage authors not to be discouraged from writing meta-analyses of subjects that have been previously reviewed and analyzed, even many times. First, in our experience, simply reproducing the work of previous meta-analyses verbatim might generate surprises. For example, Pettigrew \& Troop's landmark meta-analysis -Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) identified 515 studies and 36 ``true experiments'' (p.~759) on intergroup contact; however, when we took a look at these papers for ourselves, we found that many ``did not have over-time outcome measures, were mislabeled as randomly assigned, did not feature `actual face-to-face interaction' or did not have a non-contact control group,'' and we ultimately ended up with ``eight research reports comprising nine experiments'' (Paluck et al., 2019, p. 136). Second, we share Munger's -Munger (2023) focus on ``temporal validity,'' the idea that ``no research design, no empirical knowledge, is perfectible'' (p.~1) because the conditions under which findings hold might change dramatically over time. For instance, the implicit bias (Gawronski, 2019) and symbolic racism (McConahay \& Hough Jr, 1976; Sears \& Henry, 2003) research agendas emerged because researchers observed a dramatic drop in how readily white Americans would express overtly racist ideas in the 1970s and 80s, which called for a paradigm shift in measurement. Meta-analyses are essential for observing and documenting changes like this, and determining which class of interventions still `work' in light of new conditions. Further, as the credibility revolution spreads across the social sciences (Angrist \& Pischke, 2010; Samii, 2016; Vazire, 2018), we can generally expect recent research to meet comparatively higher standards of rigor and transparency, and therefore have a disproportionate impact on our understanding of a phenomenon. Fourth, our experience has suggested that even in fields with many systematic reviews, there's still often an open lane for a paper that's laser-focused on the findings of the best, most policy-relevant research, as Paluck et al. (2019) was, or that's both comprehensive \emph{and} quantitative, a la Porat et al. (2024) or Paluck et al. (2021).

We turn now to a discussion of these two approaches to meta-analysis.

    You might be interested in the lasting effects, which means recording the latest possible effect sizes, but if you record the \emph{earliest} possible effects, you can detect within-study decay

    \item
      Slough and Tyson (2023) argue that meta-analytic estimates only make sense if there's contrast harmony, i.e.~if the many studies are clearly testing some common underlying theoretical concept. In some literatures we've looked at, this pretty clearly does not hold, e.g.~the average effect of a contact hypothesis field experiment for Muslims and Christians and Nigeria and a diversity training in a U.S. corporate workplace tells you the combined effect of \emph{what} exactly?
    \item
      Ditto with ``target harmony'', which is whether interventions are aimed \emph{at} changing the same thing. For instance, does it make sense to average the effect of some intervention on self-reported attitudes and behavioral outcomes? As Porat et al. (2024) show, these outcomes are not always well correlated, which is prima facie evidence that we don't have target harmony.
    \item
      Last, integrating observational and randomized studies is often justified as supplementing high studies with high internal validity with studies with high \emph{external} validity, but it's probably more accurate to say that you take some studies that provide unbiased estimates and then, in exchange for greater statistical precision, induce bias arising from non-statistical sources of uncertainty (\href{http://www.donaldgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Gerber-Green-Kaplan-IllusionofLearning.pdf}{Gerber, Green and Kaplan 2004}).

      Overall meta-analytic estimate provides a within-paper size comparison; your overall effect size is X and your effect size for the very best studies is 1/3 X, that means something.
    \item
      Test for publication bias should probably look at absolutely everything
    \item
      Inter-paper comparisons; Paluck, Green and Green (2019) and Paluck et al.~(2021) provide estimates of about \(\Delta\) = 0.3, and then Green, Smith and Mathur (forthcoming) find \(\Delta\) = 0.138, which also means something.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Do some serious tests for publication bias: both conventional tests (egger's test, funnel plot, \(\Delta\) \textasciitilde{} SE), but also think through where else it might emerge, e.g.~compare effect sizes in studies with and without DOIs
\item
  separate the dataset into different chunks, e.g.~by theory, study design, or measurement strategy, and present these meta-analytic estimates side by side

\subsection{Conclusions: hard cases}\label{conclusions-hard-cases}

This paper seeks to answer two questions: what are we aiming to do when we do meta-analysis, and how do we do it?
- hope we've answered these questions satisfactorily but the big open question has to do with the extent to which metas are or are not hypothesis-driven. Other metas in the social sciences are \emph{clearly} hypothesis driven but ours are more exploratory because they're, in a word, much more meta, much more evaluative and open-ended.
- A lot of checks on RDF assume hypothesis driven framework. They are difficult to integrate into our papers.
1. What do we do when a paper's results are obviously not credible?
1. e.g.~if they present a result that's well past possible, e.g.~t-test value of 36 (one of the papers in the prejudice literature had this, and also the cost-benefit analyses in the SOSA! Intervention in the primary prevention literature)
2. What's the right outcome to code? Often very unclear what's prime or most representative of underlying construct
3. Others\ldots{}
4. Meta-analyses are still very useful, we think, for readers (both expert and non-expert) and future researchers.
