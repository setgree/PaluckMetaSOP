### Meta-analysis is (more or less) a six step process.

1)  Identify a causal question where combining results from many papers will be useful.

    1)  For instance, you might want to assess scope condition under which an effect can be expected; identify cross-study moderators that predict population- or setting-level effects that can be expected to strengthen or weaken effects; or put multiple theoretical approaches head to head to see which one works best.

    2)  The alternative to a meta-analysis, for assessing the relationship between X and Y, is to run an experiment (or otherwise well-identified study) on that relationship; but a meta-analysis can also be very helpful in figuring out what that experiment should look like.

2)  Decide which papers shed light on that question.

    1)  In practice this means operationalizing X and Y, which might not be straightforward: does imagined contact count as contact? What exactly is prejudice, and how do we measure it?

    2)  It also means setting inclusion criteria related to, e.g., internal validity, measurement error, or population. For instance, your meta-analysis might be focused only on the results of [policy-relevant randomized controlled trials](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-public-policy/article/contact-hypothesis-reevaluated/142C913E7FA9E121277B29E994124EC5), a [particular class of dependent variable](https://osf.io/a7g95/), or the effects of [sexual violence prevention programs on college campuses](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(23)00117-9/abstract).

3)  Gather and read all such papers (re: conduct a systematic search).

4)  Condense each study's results to a single point estimate, or a cluster of point estimates, and associated variance(s).

5)  Aggregate those estimates into a pooled average effect and any relevant subgroup effects.

6)  Write up your results.

The vignettes in this package are designed to help you with steps 4-6.

### The vignettes:

Vignettes 1 and 2 are about standardizing effect sizes and variance. The first is for "easy" cases where you can use `d_calc` and `var_d_calc` without too much extra work; the second talks through a few edge cases we've encountered over time. are about calculating effect sizes from data in papers.

The third vignette is about how to actually do meta-analysis, i.e. combine your point estimates into pooled estimates that tell you about overall effects and subgroup effects.

The fourth walks through the other functions we've written to help write a meta-analysis paper.

The fifth gives examples of some visualizations we've done for past meta-analyses.
