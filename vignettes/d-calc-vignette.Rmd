## Introduction
This vignette explains and demonstrates the `d_calc.R` and `var_d_calc.R` functions. 

`d_calc` is a calculator that converts a study's results into an estimate of a standardized mean effect, typically called `d` or ∆ (Delta); `var_d_calc` provides estimates of the variance and standard error to accompany that first estimate. These variables are the foundation of a meta-analysis.

Our functions mostly implement equations from [Cooper, Hedges, and Valentine (2009)](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/the-handbook-of-research-synthesis-and-meta-analysis-2nd-edition), particularly chapters 12 and 13, which cover standardized mean effect sizes. In one case (the difference in proportions estimator), we depart from those equations, which we'll explain when we get to it.

This vignette is not an exhaustive overview of why, how and when to convert a study into a single point estimate -- see Cooper, Hedges, and Valentine for that. Instead, we show you how we've used these in the past to make meta-analyses go more smoothly. 

Most of our examples will be from [The Contact Hypothesis Re-evaluated](https://doi.org/10.1017/bpp.2018.25), with a few examples drawn from [Preventing Sexual Violence —A Behavioral Problem Without a Behaviorally-Informed Solution](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/xgbzj).

This vignette first defines the functions' necessary inputs; then works through examples of each type of statistical information that `d_calc` is designed to interpret; then provides two examples of how to incorporate these functions into your workflow.

### The core parameters:
`d_calc` takes in between 2-5 inputs, depending on the value of the first input:
* `stat_type`, the type of statistical information that a study's results are reported as;
`stat`, the value of that stat_type (e.g. F = 1.0 or reg_coef (regression coefficient) = 0.2);
* `sample_sd`, which is an estimate of the standard deviation of the dependent variable, drawn either from the entire sample (for cohen's d) or from the control group (for Glass's ∆). This parameter will not be necessary if the stat_type already conveys information about the variance (F-test, t-test, or `d`);
* n_t`,  the sample size for the treatment group;
* `n_c`, the sample size for the control group. 

`d_calc` then returns a single number, which corresponds to cohen's `d` or Glass's ∆ depending on what `sample_sd` you provided.

`var_d_calc` takes as input:

* d, typically the output of `d_calc`;
* `n_t`,  the sample size for the treatment group;
* `n_c`, the sample size for the control group. 

We'll now work through each of the possible values of `stat_type`
