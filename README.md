# PaluckMetaSOP

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package documents the [Paluck lab's](https://www.betsylevypaluck.com/) approach to meta-analysis. 

It was built with instructions in the [_R packages_](https://r-pkgs.org/) book and accompanies a forthcoming paper.  

Install via `devtools::install_github("setgree/PaluckMetaSOP")`.

I am currently writing vignettes; the functions are mostly done.

### Package TODOs
1. finish SMD vignette
2. write vignette on meta-analytic functions
3. write vignette on "write paper" and "summary statistics" functions
4. write vignette on d_i_p -> ∆
5. write vignette on hard cases -> ∆
6. double-check everything works as intended and also in a general way
7. all code examples in every function should be reproducible  (use dataset?)
8. tidy dataset to omit a few rows, change a few eff_types, and add a few column back in (I'm not sure where "what" went, the column that tells you where data comes from)
