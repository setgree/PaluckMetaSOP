# PaluckMetaSOP

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package documents the [Paluck lab's](https://www.betsylevypaluck.com/) approach to meta-analysis. 

It was built with instructions in the [_R packages_](https://r-pkgs.org/) book and accompanies a forthcoming paper.  

Install via `devtools::install_github("setgree/PaluckMetaSOP")`.

I am currently writing vignettes; the functions are mostly done (though I am paring them down a bit -- the `utils.R` script can just be put into vignettes or something)
(broseVignettes() works so long as I install with `build_vignettes = TRUE !`)

### Package TODOs
1. edit SMD vignette
2. write vignette on meta-analytic functions
3. write vignette on "write paper" and "summary statistics" functions
4. write vignette on hard cases -> ∆
5. double-check everything works as intended and also in a general way
6. double-check everything (get a second reader/user?)
7. where's the big PDF you want (it might be an error related to ∆)
