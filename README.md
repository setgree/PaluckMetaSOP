# PaluckMetaSOP

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package documents the [Paluck labâ€™s](http://www.betsylevypaluck.com/)
approach to meta-analysis.

It was built with instructions in the [*R
packages*](https://r-pkgs.org/) book and accompanies a forthcoming
paper.

Install via 
`devtools::install_github('setgree/PaluckMetaSOP', build_vignettes = T)`.

I am currently finishing the vignettes; the functions are mostly done.

### Package TODOs
1. write final vignette on "write paper" and "summary statistics" functions
2. finish d-calc vignette when I hear back from expert friend
3. double-check everything works as intended and also in a general way (get a second reader)
