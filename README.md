<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This paper and package document the [Paluck lab's](https://www.betsylevypaluck.com/) approach to meta-analysis. 

This repo is a hybrid of a package, built with instructions in the [_R packages_](https://r-pkgs.org/) book, and a paper manuscript that uses Papaja to convert from `Rmd` -> `.tex` -> `.pdf` with equations intact. 

Install via `devtools::install_github("setgree/PaluckMetaSOP")`.

### Package TODOs

For the package, I need 
* tests (maybe)
* double-check everything works as intended and also in a general way
* include JH's functions from the prejudice paper (maybe with his help)

### Paper TODOs

* Write the paper
* document it accordingly
* figure out an automated/easy way to collaborate with authros who prefer overleaf or github
* convert to Quarto?
