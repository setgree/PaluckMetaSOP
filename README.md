# PaluckMetaSOP

This package documents the [Paluck labâ€™s](http://www.betsylevypaluck.com/)
approach to meta-analysis.

It was built with instructions in the [*R
packages*](https://r-pkgs.org/) book and accompanies a forthcoming
paper.

Install via 
`devtools::install_github('setgree/PaluckMetaSOP', build_vignettes = T)`.

I am currently finishing the vignettes; the functions are mostly done.

### If you are a member of the Paluck Lab who is extending this package:
I recommend you clone this package and begin by adding or amending R packages and/or vignettes. The instructions in the first chapter of [*R
packages*](https://r-pkgs.org/) should get you pretty far on the "building a package" side of things.

### Package TODOs
1. finish d-calc vignette when I hear back from more expert colleague
2. why do all the vignettes look so bad when they're browsed -- figures are tiny and math mode isn't rendered
3. put down for a week and then read over everything
4. get a second reader to double-check everything works as intended and also in a general way
