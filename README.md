# PaluckMetaSOP

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package documents the [Paluck lab’s](www.betsylevypaluck.com/)
approach to meta-analysis.

It was built with instructions in the [*R
packages*](https://r-pkgs.org/) book and accompanies a forthcoming
paper.

Install via `devtools::install_github("setgree/PaluckMetaSOP")`.

I am currently writing vignettes; the functions are mostly done (though
I am paring them down a bit – the `utils.R` script can just be put into
vignettes or something) (broseVignettes() works so long as I install
with `build_vignettes = TRUE` – and I finally have a manual after doing
a lot of *manual* fixes of html issues and whatever)

### Package TODOs

1.  write vignette on meta-analytic functions
2.  write vignette on “write paper” and “summary statistics” functions
3.  finish vignette on hard cases -\> delta
4.  double-check everything works as intended and also in a general way
5.  look at all the notes which are weird but whatevs
6.  Lots more examples for functions in the documentation! and also
    update description to note that the main way to use this package is
    to read the vignettes
7.  double-check everything (get a second reader/user?)
