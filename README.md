# PaluckMetaSOP

This package documents the [Paluck labâ€™s](http://www.betsylevypaluck.com/)
approach to meta-analysis.

Install via 
`remotes::install_github('setgree/PaluckMetaSOP', build_vignettes = T)`.

### If you are a member of the Paluck Lab who is extending this package:
You can 
* clone this package (` git clone https://github.com/setgree/PaluckMetaSOP.git`)
* add or amend functions and vignettes 
* then either open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for this package or create your own fork and work from there. 

The instructions in the first chapter of [*R
packages*](https://r-pkgs.org/) should get you pretty far on the "building a package" side of things.

IMO, the last outstanding TODO is to get a second reader to double-check everything makes sense!
